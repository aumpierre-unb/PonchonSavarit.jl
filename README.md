## The PonchonSavarit Module for Julia

PonchonSavarit provides the following functions:

- **stages**
- **refmin**
- **qR2S**
- **qS2R**
- **RS2q**

### **stages**

stages computes the number of theoretical stages of a distillation column using the Ponchon-Savarit method from the top to the bottom of the column given a x-h-y-H matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions at equilibrium and their enthalpies, the vector of the fractions of the products and two parameters among the feed quality, the reflux ratio at the top of the column and the reflux ratio at the bottom of the column.

If feed is a saturated liquid, feed quality q = 1, feed quality is reset to q = 1 - 1e-10.

By default, fig = true, stages plots a schematic diagram of the solution. If fig = false is given, no plot is shown.

**Syntax:**

```julia
stages(data::Union{Matrix{Float64},Function},z::Vector{Float64};
  q::Number=NaN,R::Number=NaN,S::Number=NaN,fig::Bool=true)
```

**Examples:**

Compute the number of theoretical stages of a distillation column for acetone and methanol from the bottom to the top of the column given a matrix that relates the liquid and the vapor fractions and their enthalpies at equilibrium, the composition of the distillate is 93 %, the composition of the feed is 41 %, the composition of the bottoms is 7 %, the feed is a saturated liquid and the reflux ratio at the top of the column is 55 % higher that the minimum reflux ratio, and plot a schematic diagram of the solution:
