## The PonchonSavarit Module for Julia

PonchonSavarit provides the following functions:

- stages
- refmin
- qR2S

### stages

stages omputes the number of theoretical stages
of a distillation column using the Ponchon-Savarit method given
a x-h-y-H matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions
at equilibrium and their enthalpies,
the vector of the fractions of the products and the feed,
the feed quality, and the reflux ratio at the top of the column.
If feed is a saturated liquid, feed quality q = 1,
feed quality is reset to q = 1 - 1e-10.
By default, stages plots a schematic diagram of the solution, fig = true.
If fig = false is given, no plot is shown.

If feed is a saturated liquid, feed quality q = 1,
feed quality is reset to q = 1 - 1e-10.

By default, stages plots a schematic diagram of the solution, fig = true.

If fig = false is given, no plot is shown.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli
N=stages(y,X,q,R[,updown[,fig]])
```

**Examples:**

of a distillation column for oxygen and nitrogen
from the bottom to the top of the column given
a matrix that relates the liquid and the vapor fractions
and their enthalpies at equilibrium,
the composition of the distillate is 88 %,
the composition of the feed is 46 %,
the composition of the column's bottom product is 11 %,
the feed quality is 54 %, and
the reflux ratio at the top of the column is
70 % higher that the minimum reflux ratio:
